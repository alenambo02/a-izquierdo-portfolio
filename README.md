# Alejandra Izquierdo's Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio was created to display various projects I have worked on that demonstrate numerous technical skills I've gained independently and throughout my bootcamp journey at UC Berkeley Extension. This portfolio in itself demonstrates my ability to work with REACT, JSX, CSS, and Javascript.
